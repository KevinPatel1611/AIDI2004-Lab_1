# Description
1. **get_user_input():**
   - This function prompts the user to input a key or string.
   - The `input()` function is used to capture user input, and the entered value is stored in the `user_input` variable.
   - The user's input is then returned by the function.

2. **process_input(input_data):**
   - The `process_input` function takes the user's input as an argument (`input_data`).
   - It processes the input by converting it to uppercase using the `upper()` method.
   - The processed data is stored in the `processed_data` variable, which is then returned.

3. **display_result(result):**
   - This function is responsible for displaying the result of the key programming activity.
   - It takes the processed result (`result`) as an argument and prints it to the console.

4. **main():**
   - The `main` function serves as the main entry point for the program.
   - It initiates the key programming activities by calling the functions in the following order:
      - `get_user_input()`: Obtains user input.
      - `process_input(user_input)`: Processes the user input.
      - `display_result(processed_result)`: Displays the processed result.

5. **Execution:**
   - The script begins its execution by calling `main()` only if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module).
   - The user is prompted to enter a key or string, and the program then processes and displays the input in uppercase.

This code is a simple illustration of a common pattern in programming where user input is obtained, processed, and the result is displayed. It can serve as a starting point for more complex key programming activities based on specific requirements.
